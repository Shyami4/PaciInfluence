# PAC-Influence: Understanding and Leveraging Social Connections in Ticketing

This project explores how **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** and **predictive modeling** can be applied to ticketing ecosystems to identify key influencers, uncover community structures, and drive smarter marketing strategies.  
Our case study is built on Paciolanâ€™s data ecosystem, focusing on how interpersonal connections influence event attendance and donations â€” particularly in **collegiate sports and community events**, where decisions are rarely made in isolation.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
The dashboard and analysis demonstrate:
- **Network graph visualizations** to detect communities and identify high-influence nodes.
- **Descriptive analytics** on customer engagement patterns.
- **Predictive models** for ticket transfer propensity and donation likelihood.
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** to explore results and run simulations.

This public repo contains **only the Python scripts** and demo video â€” datasets are excluded for privacy.
